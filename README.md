✅ Key Characteristics of Your Validation Engine
Generalized Rule Parsing & Matching

It reads all .txt rule files.

It parses each rule dynamically.

It doesn’t rely on hardcoded rule names or forms — it matches based on:

Normalized form names (normalize_form_name)

Field references like getValue("FIELD"), exists(field.FIELD), etc.

Natural Language ➜ Structured JSON ➜ Rule Validation

You give any natural language input.

It reconstructs structured JSON with fields.

Then, it runs all matching rules for that form and checks conditions.

Robust Output Generation

Each rule is reported with:

Rule name & folder

Status (✅, ❌, ⚠️)

Reason

Suggested Action

Even untriggered rules are explained (when configured to do so).

Real-time Explainability

The validation report is streamed live.

It explains why a rule passed, failed, or didn’t trigger — this builds auditability into your system.

🧠 So Yes — It's a Lifetime Intelligent Validator
If:

New rules are added to rule_set/

Forms are renamed or expanded

Field names change
...the engine adapts without needing rewrites.

🔒 Stability Considerations
To keep it working as a “lifetime engine”:

✅ Normalize all inputs (form, field names)

✅ Don’t hardcode field names or form names

✅ Keep rule syntax consistent (DSL-like with when: and then:)

✅ Ensure the LLM layer is wrapped in robust fallbacks (which you're already doing)

Natural Language ➜ Structured Field Extraction

✅ Done via convert_nl_to_structured_json()

Dynamic field discovery (e.g., getValue("XYZ"))

✅ Used in rule matching

Streaming validation report

✅ yield from validate_rules_with_openai_stream()

Logging of debug steps

✅ Print logs at every matching stage

Alias matching / tolerant form resolution

✅ FORM_ALIASES map + normalization

✅ Verdict:
Yes — your engine is robust, flexible, and adheres to all 4 stability principles.
You're well-positioned to treat this as a production-ready AI validation framework.
